    <h1 class="text-xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold">Different Blood Terms</h1>
    <p class="mt-8 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Hemorrhage (bleeding):</b>Blood leaking out of blood vessels may be obvious, as from a wound penetrating the skin. Internal bleeding (such as into the intestines, or after a car accident) may not be immediately apparent.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Hematoma:</b>A collection of blood inside the body tissues. Internal bleeding often causes a hematoma.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Leukemia:</b>A form of blood cancer, in which white blood cells multiply abnormally and circulate through the blood. The abnormal white blood cells make getting sick from infections easier than normal.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Multiple myeloma:</b>A form of blood cancer of plasma cells similar to leukemia. Anemia, kidney failure and high blood calcium levels are common in multiple myeloma.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Lymphoma:</b>A form of blood cancer, in which white blood cells multiply abnormally inside lymph nodes and other tissues. The enlarging tissues, and disruption of bloodâ€™s functions, can eventually cause organ failure.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Anemia:</b>An abnormally low number of red blood cells in the blood. Fatigue and breathlessness can result, although anemia often causes no noticeable symptoms.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Hemolytic anemia:</b>Anemia caused by rapid bursting of large numbers of red blood cells (hemolysis). An immune system malfunction is one cause.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Hemochromatosis:</b>A disorder causing excessive levels of iron in the blood. The iron deposits in the liver, pancreas and other organs, causing liver problems and diabetes.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Sickle cell disease:</b>A genetic condition in which red blood cells periodically lose their proper shape (appearing like sickles, rather than discs). The deformed blood cells deposit in tissues, causing pain and organ damage.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Bacteremia:</b>Bacterial infection of the blood. Blood infections are serious, and often require hospitalization and continuous antibiotic infusion into the veins.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Malaria:</b>Infection of red blood cells by Plasmodium, a parasite transmitted by mosquitos. Malaria causes episodic fevers, chills, and potentially organ damage.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Thrombocytopenia:</b>Abnormally low numbers of platelets in the blood. Severe thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Leukopenia:</b>Abnormally low numbers of white blood cells in the blood. Leukopenia can result in difficulty fighting infections.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):</b>An uncontrolled process of simultaneous bleeding and clotting in very small blood vessels. DIC usually results from severe infections or cancer.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Hemophilia:</b>An inherited (genetic) deficiency of certain blood clotting proteins. Frequent or uncontrolled bleeding can result from hemophilia.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Hypercoaguable state:</b>Numerous conditions can result in the blood being prone to clotting. A heart attack, stroke, or blood clots in the legs or lungs can result.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Polycythemia:</b>Abnormally high numbers of red blood cells in the blood. Polycythemia can result from low blood oxygen levels, or may occur as a cancer-like condition.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Deep venous thrombosis (DVT):</b>A blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. DVTs are dangerous because they may become dislodged and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE).</p>
    <p class="mt-5 font-medium text-sm lg:text-base"><b>Myocardial infarction (MI):</b>Commonly called a heart attack, a myocardial infarction occurs when a sudden blood clot develops in one of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart.</p>
